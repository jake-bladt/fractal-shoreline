# fractal shoreline

## overview

This is a proof-of-concept project to address two questions: 

- If given an ordered sequence of Cartesian points, can we determine whether or not it's possible to create a solid, contiguous polygon by connecting them in order?
- Given a solid, contiguous polygon, can we create a function that transforms it into a realistic-looking land mass by increasing the fractalness of its shoreline?

The work is meant to be used in the [WorldBuilder](https://github.com/jake-bladt/worldbuilder) project.

## notes

The math for this may be the [complex hull algorithm](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/775753/A-Convex-Hull-Algorithm-and-its-implementation-in).
